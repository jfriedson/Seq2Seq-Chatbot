# Seq2seq Chatbot using Evolved Transformers
Youtube tutorial: link
By Josh Friedson

lots of code taken and modified from https://github.com/fawazsammani/chatbot-transformer

tested on python 3.7.6 and pytorch 1.5.1

## dependencies
just pytorch  :)


## Training
The Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus data has already been prepared and preprocessed.
A seq2seq model has already been trained.  Test it by running "chatprog.py"

__To continue training the existing model, run "train.py"__


## how to use chatprog.py
enter "bye" to exit the program

## note:
none of the runnable scripts accepts command line arguments.  Modify the network and training parameters in the files.
